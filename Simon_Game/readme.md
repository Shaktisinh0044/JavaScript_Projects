# 🎮 Simon Game

**Live Preview:** 👉 [Play Simon Game](https://shaktisinh0044.github.io/JavaScript_Projects/Simon_Game/) (opens in new tab)

A classic memory challenge where a sequence of colored buttons lights up and you must repeat it in order. Built with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.

## 🧠 Core Features / Functions

1. 🔂 **Starts on any key press** — user interaction triggers gameplay. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
2. 🎨 **Four interactive buttons** (1, 2, 3, 4) that light up on clicks. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
3. 🔊 **Sound feedback** for each button press (typical Simon behavior). *(Inferred)*  
4. 🔢 **Random generated sequence** that grows each level. *(Standard logic)*  
5. 📈 **Level counter** showing how far the player progressed. *(Standard logic)*  
6. ❌ **Fail detection** — game ends when wrong button clicked. *(Standard logic)*  
7. 💥 **Visual feedback** on correct / wrong attempts. *(Standard logic)*  
8. ⏱️ **Replay sequence** each round to train memory. *(Standard logic)*  
9. 📱 **Responsive for clicks / taps** on button elements. *(Standard logic)*  
10. 🎥 **“How To Play?” link** to tutorial / video. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

*(If your CSS and JS have extra animations, sound files, or score tracking, add them here)*

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User presses any key to **start the game**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
2. Game shows random sequence of buttons lighting up.  
3. Player repeats sequence by clicking buttons.  
4. If correct, level increments and sequence grows.  
5. If wrong, game over and restart from level 1.

## ⚡ Suggestions (Brutally Honest)

- Your live page currently only shows buttons and start text — **add level display and score** visibly.  
- If your JS has no sound, integrate short beeps per button (memory game relies on audio).  
- Add **restart / play again UI** instead of relying on page reload.  
- Clean up HTML so it’s accessible (buttons should have ARIA labels, not just numbers).
